# Predictive-Modeling-for-Agriculture
## Dive into agriculture using supervised machine learning and feature selection to aid farmers in crop cultivation and solve real-world problems.

**Project Description:** <br>
A farmer seeking help to select the best crop for his field. Due to budget constraints, the farmer could only afford to measure two out of the four essential soil measures: <br>

- Nitrogen content ratio in the soil <br>
- Phosphorous content ratio in the soil <br>
- Potassium content ratio in the soil <br>
- pH value of the soil <br>
This is a classic feature selection problem, where the objective is to pick the most important features that could help predict the crop accurately.

**Project Tasks:** <br>
In this project, Two techniques for feature selection are applied to solve the farmer's problem. The project shows valuable insights into how machine learning can solve real-world agricultural problems.
